Python Programs for Beginners

1] Guess the number
This is a very basic program which uses the random module.
It randomly generates an integer between 0-20 and asks the user to guess the number.It then displays whether the number is correctly guessed or "too high" if its greater and"too low" if its smaller than the generated integer.

2] Rock,Paper and Scissors
This is a rock-paper-scissors game where it is the player vs the computer. The computerâ€™s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will ask the user for their input.The first one to get 5 points wins.
This project will better your understanding of while loops and if statements.

3] Password Generator

Have a mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. The password should be a minimum of 6 characters long.

4] Guess the TV show
